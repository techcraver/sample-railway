# Sample Jekyll Template for Railway

This is a simple [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) starter template, built as part of my Railway Community Engineer interview project. I chose Jekyll because it’s fast, easy to customize, and ideal for static content like blogs, docs, or personal landing pages. Plus, it runs light; making it a great fit for a quick, no-fuss Railway deployment.

With this template, you can spin up a clean site in seconds using Railway’s one-click deploy flow. It’s a minimal setup, but a solid base to build on; whether you're showcasing a portfolio, writing posts in Markdown, or just exploring how static sites work on Railway.
